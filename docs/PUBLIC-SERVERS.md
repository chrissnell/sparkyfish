# About Public Servers
Members of the Sparkyfish community have kindly made available some public Sparkyfish servers for your testing.
Most of these servers are running on public cloud instances and have ~100-200 Mbit/s up/down capacity so they may
not be suitable for testing your machine if you have a connection that's faster than that.

# Current Public Servers
The easiest way to test is to use one of the round-robin hostnames below.  These rotate amongst their geographic peers and automatically remove any failed servers from the rotation:

| Hostname | Geographic Area|
|----------|----------------|
|us.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com| North America |
|eu.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com| Europe |

If you want to try a specific server, here's a list of the current public servers.  All of these servers run on port 7121 unless otherwise indicated:

| Hostname / Port | Location | Sponsor| ISP| Link Capacity | Protocol |
|----------|----------|-----|----|-----------|----------|
| us-seattle.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com | Seattle, WA | Nigel VH | Blue Box | 150 Mbps up/down| IPv4 + IPv6 |
| sparky.ga.hamwan.net | Atlanta, GA | W4AQL | Georgia Institute of Technology | 1 Gbps up/down | IPv4|
| eu-netherlands.sparkyfish.chrissnell.com | Amsterdam, NL | Josh Braegger |DigitalOcean| 30 Mbps up/down | IPv4 |
| eu-germany.sparkyfish.com | Gunzenhausen, DE | Kirk Harr | Hetzner.de | 10 Mbps up/down | IPv4 + IPv6 |
